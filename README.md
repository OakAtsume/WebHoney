# WebSpeare : A Deceptive Web Tarpit

**WebSpeare** is a lightweight, zero-dependency honeypot written entirely in Ruby.
Designed to enable malicious web crawlers, automated hacking tools, and
Opportunistic threat actors.

It generates constantly changing pages filled with random Shakespearean excerpts,
Fabricated error logs, and enticing false hyperlinks. A woven snare to waste time and
Resources of malicious bots!

Ideal for gathering threat intelligence in high traffic systems,
Studying automated behavior, and disrupting tools like SQLMap, BurpSuite, nikto, nuclie
And more!

## Features:

* Dynamic page generation - Randomized content perfect for keeping bots stuck!
* Shakespearean quotes - a tasteful taunt.
* Lots of triggers - Fake links, error artifacts to lure and mislead
* Small and easy to parse - Perfect for passive defense, research and bot profiling
* Easy parsing - activity is logged cleanly in `.json` and `.log` formats (Silimar to cowrie)
* Flexible and adjustable - adjust anything you desire via simple JSON files and an HTML template
